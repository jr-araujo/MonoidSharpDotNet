This library aims to bring Functional Styling into CSharp language. All of us know that C# is essentially an Object Oriented Programming Language, but we believe that is really possible to apply functional concepts into object-oriented languages and gain great benefits from this programming style, becoming your code much better readable, maintainable, reliable and with all of it working together will help you keep your focus on only in business rules.
